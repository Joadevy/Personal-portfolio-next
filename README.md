## Overview
This is my personal portfolio, basically my web-page to contain personal information and links to my best projects.   
Initially built with HTML/CSS but then, while I learned new technologies, migrated to NextJS to have performance improvements and, more important in this small project, being more resilient to my future changes.   
   
Besides, in the last update, I added a chat that integrates an AI to classify different type of questions and answer them with personal information.

## My process
I chose to create my portfolio with a scalability perspective so as to update it easily by putting my future projects on it. I thought about all the design and I picked a minimalist style with my personal touch. It was great and I felt comfortable with the making-process.

### Built with

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- SASS & CSS modules
- Control version system using Git

### What I learned

I'm proud of this because I started with an idea and I was be able to got it. I like the "final" result (The project will evolve with me and my constantly way to become a better dev).  
I used NextJS in v13 version and took advantage of the server components because the most part of the site have static information. Then I also used client-components to handle user interaction.  
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.   
Also I learned more about web design. Then I used git in order to handle the versions of the project.
I'll keep working on it!
